I'm a high school student with a silly little homelab. I run my own infrastructure, and mostly use Ubiquiti gear for networking as it's awesome.
I really enjoy pentesting things, or trying to break/intrude stuff like access control systems or online platforms.

I'm *GARBAGE* at art.

My pronouns are he/him.
I define my gender as male.
